## Summary: 
- The webpage provides examples of UFO sightings in the US,  displaying data on structured table. This table can be filtered by the user input based on date, city , state, country and shape labels. The webpage has been well arranged and decorated using Bootstrap features and CSS. 

    - ### Recommendations:
        - Implement live data opposed to manual info input.
        - To have ability to filter using duration of sighting.
        - further dev of the project can be added using larger areas of the world and dates etc.
